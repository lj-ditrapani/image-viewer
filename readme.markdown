Image Viewer
==============

This project implements a basic JavaScript image viewer with forward and back buttons to cycle through a collection of image and description pairs.

This project depends on utils.js
Download utils.js from ditrapani.info or lj-ditrapani @ github.com

The interface
--------------
The user must provide an HTML div element with the id="image-viewer".  The image-viewer will create elements with the following ids (so you can style them how you want in the CSS.)

    - Image viewer container:  image-viewer
    - Forward button:  forward-button
    - Back button:  back-button
